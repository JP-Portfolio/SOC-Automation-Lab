# SOC-Automation-Lab

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a robust Security Operations Center (SOC) automation workflow using **Wazuh and SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) technologies, specifically integrating TheHive, Shuffle, and VirusTotal. This implementation showcases a proactive approach to security incident detection, response, and analysis, leveraging cloud infrastructure and automated processes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of threat handling.

### Skills Learned

- **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Mastery in deploying and managing SOC tools on cloud platforms, with a focus on DigitalOcean.
- **Configuration Management**: Proficient in configuring Windows systems for security monitoring and reporting to Wazuh.
- **Workflow Automation**: Developed complex workflows in Shuffle to automate the response to security events.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Gained expertise in enriching Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) using VirusTotal and integrating findings into TheHive for alert management.
- **Active Response**: Implemented Wazuhâ€™s active response feature to automate the mitigation of identified threats.

### Tools Used

- **Wazuh**: An open-source security monitoring solution for threat detection, integrity monitoring, incident response, and compliance.
- **TheHive**: A scalable, open-source and free Security Incident Response Platform designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, and CERTs.
- **Shuffle**: An open-source SOAR platform that helps automate and connect security tools for improved efficiency and effectiveness of operational security.
- **DigitalOcean**: A cloud infrastructure provider offering cloud services to help deploy modern apps.

## Steps

### Network Diagram

The network diagram depicts a streamlined SOAR implementation using Wazuh and Shuffle. The general overview of this project is as follows.

1. **Event Detection**: The Windows 10 client with Wazuh Agent detects a security event and sends the details to the Wazuh Manager.
2. **Event Forwarding**: The Wazuh Manager forwards the event to Shuffle for processing.
3. **IOC Enrichment**: Shuffle enriches the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) using VirusTotal.
4. **Alert Creation**: Shuffle generates an alert and sends it to TheHive case management system with enriched information.
5. **Notification**: Shuffle sends an email notification to the SOC Analyst about the incident with major event information.
6. **User Input**: The SOC Analyst provide the input to perform response action via email.
7. **Action Execution**: Shuffle instructs the Wazuh Manager to execute a response action, such as terminating a malicious process.

This process ensures efficient and automated handling of security incidents, from detection to response.

### Wazuh and TheHive Configuration

I am using **DigitalOcean** as a cloud provider to host Wazuh and TheHive. I have created two Ubuntu VMs with following specifications: 
RAM: 8GB+<br>
HDD: 50GB+<br>
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS<br>

Created firewall and added rules to allow only self-access to both VMs.

#### Wazuh Installation and Configuration
_curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a_<br>
_sudo tar -xvf wazuh-install-files.tar_<br>

You will be presented with login credentials after installation. Use VM's public IP to login into Wazuh Dashboard. You can also find the login credentials in Wazuh-install-files directory. Next step is to deploy wazuh-agent on Windows Client.
1. Click drop-down menu and Select Agents. You will see list of all deployed Agents. Initially you won't find any.
2. Click Deploy New Agent and Select Windows and enter your Wazuh server IP and you will be presented with Powershell command to run on Client machine.
3. Run command as administrator and start the wazuh-service using command _NET START WazuhSvc_
4. Now the Agent will report to Wazuh Manager and you will see the active agents as shown in screenshot.

### Sysmon Log Ingestion in Wazuh

By default Wazuh dosen't log Symon events. To do so we need to make changes in the **ossec.conf** configuration file on Wazuh-Cleint and Wazuh-Manager.
1. On Windows client configure Wazuh-agent to send all the sysmon related events to Wazuh-Manager **C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf**. After making changes restrat the Wazuh service on client.

2. On Wazuh-Manager make following changes to **/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf**

![Screenshot 2024-06-19 184457](https://github.com/JP-Portfolio/SOC-Automation-Lab/assets/167912526/baa60475-cfb8-4f53-9945-c0026bb0377c)

3. On Wazuh-Manager open **/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml**, which is a service designed to collect and forward log data to central processing and storage systems, such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, or other log management solutions and make following changes: It will send all the logs to Wazuh.

![Screenshot 2024-06-19 184457](https://github.com/JP-Portfolio/SOC-Automation-Lab/assets/167912526/3a11ae6e-e2ad-4678-8ea0-28cd0b98daaf)

4. Restrat the wazuh.manger and filebeat services using command: **systemctl restart wazuh-manager.service && systemctl restart filebeat**
5. Open Wazuh Dashboard and create and select new index pattern **(Stack Management > Index Patterns > Create Index Pattern)**

5. Create a custom rule to detect Mimikatz!! Locate the **local_rules.xml** file (all the custome rules are stored in this file) and add the following rule:

![Screenshot 2024-06-19 191718](https://github.com/JP-Portfolio/SOC-Automation-Lab/assets/167912526/c64fae98-eb9e-4a6b-8115-5c92416f6791)
![Screenshot 2024-06-19 191343](https://github.com/JP-Portfolio/SOC-Automation-Lab/assets/167912526/06e6b8d9-eddc-48ec-9503-f6a0b17de200)

_The **OriginalFileName** field is derived from the PE (Portable Executable) header of the file. This field is particularly useful for security monitoring and incident response, as it can help identify malicious processes even if they are masquerading as legitimate system processes by using the same process name. For example, if we change the the name of a Mimikatz executable to avoid detection, the OriginalFileName field still can help reveal the processâ€™s true identity._

6. Test the rule!! To see the effectiveness of rule I already change the executable name.

### SOAR Implementation using Shuffle

1. Create a Shuffle account and new workflow with appropriate Name, Description and Usaecase. https://shuffler.io/workflows
2. Select the **Webhook** triggr and name it to Wazuh-Alert. Copy the Webhook URI, which is requires to integrate Shuffle with Wazuh.

![Screenshot 2024-06-19 194606](https://github.com/JP-Portfolio/SOC-Automation-Lab/assets/167912526/1a149016-9957-4160-bd39-5232f4cd016a)

3. Open the **/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf** file on Wazuh-Manager and make following changes to integrate shuffle:

![Screenshot 2024-06-19 193858](https://github.com/JP-Portfolio/SOC-Automation-Lab/assets/167912526/f9411bcb-e181-464c-a68c-64fc0c8ea7f6)

4. Start the Webhook and run Mimikatz again to check if we get alert on Shuffle:

![Screenshot 2024-06-19 195652](https://github.com/JP-Portfolio/SOC-Automation-Lab/assets/167912526/f65bfff7-cb85-4547-bea4-ac9fc497f2c1)

5. We successfully got Alert on Shuffle..Next we will extract the SHA256 hash from the event data. Click on Change Me and rename it to **SHA256-regex**. Change Find Actions to **Regex Capture Group**. Input following Regex to parse hash: **SHA256=([A-F0-9]+)**. Select Input Data to point the hash values from the event field as below and save the workflow.
